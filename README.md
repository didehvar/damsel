# Damsel

Oh ye, oh ye!

There was once a fair maiden, henceforth known as Black Magus, who worked
tirelessly each and every day for mere squires throughout the land. Trapped
within the castle of the sheriff, Google, in his divine tower - which he, quite
reasonably, named Drive - she weeped and weeped; hoping one day that a legendary
knight would save her from this terrible prison. Alas, three seasons later, thy
poor maiden was still trapped in her seemingly eternal prison...

Where, oh where, is the legendary knight who shalt save this poor damsel?
